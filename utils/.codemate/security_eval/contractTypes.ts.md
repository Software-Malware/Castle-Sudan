## Code Reviewed

```typescript
export type ContractFunction = {
  name: string
  type: 'function'
  stateMutability: 'view' | 'pure' | 'nonpayable' | 'payable'
  inputs: {
    name: string
    type: string
    internalType: string
  }[]
  outputs: {
    name: string
    type: string
    internalType: string
  }[]
}
```

## Security Vulnerability Assessment

### 1. **Type-Only Code**

The code provided is a TypeScript type definition, intended to define the structure of data rather than executable functionality.

### 2. **Direct Vulnerabilities**

- **None Detected:** No direct security vulnerabilities are present in the type definition itself. There is no runtime logic, external input handling, or processing of untrusted data.

### 3. **Potential Indirect Vulnerabilities**

While the type definition lacks direct risks, its context and usage could affect security:

- **Improper Validation Elsewhere:** If other application components use this type to accept or process user-supplied contract ABIs or function definitions, improper validation can lead to risks such as:
  - Injection attacks (if generated code or queries are constructed from these fields without proper sanitization).
  - Incorrect assumptions about types leading to unsafe contract calls.

- **Dynamic Handling:** If the application ingests and interacts with smart contracts using these types, developers should ensure:
  - Only trusted or rigorously validated contract ABIs/definitions are accepted.
  - String fields (e.g., `name`, `internalType`, `type`) should be properly sanitized elsewhere, especially if used for dynamic code generation or included in UI.

### 4. **Recommendations**

- **Validate Input:** Ensure that any data matching this type imported from external sources (especially user input or untrusted sources) is validated for expected structure and value types.
- **Sanitize Strings:** Prevent usage of untrusted string values in dangerous contexts (e.g., code generation, database queries, UI rendering) without sanitization.
- **Least Privilege Usage:** If these types are used to reflect contract capabilities, enforce least privilege by not allowing arbitrary input to influence authorization or access controls.

## Summary

> **No intrinsic security vulnerabilities were found in `utils/contractTypes.ts` itself.**  
> Risks depend on whether and how data structured by this type is consumed/processed elsewhere in your application. Defensive programming and input validation are recommended in all dependent code.
