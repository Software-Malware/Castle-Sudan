# High-Level Documentation

## Overview

This code defines and exports a default user interface component instance using the `heroui` library from the `@heroui/react` package.

## Structure

- **Import Statement**:  
  - Imports the `heroui` function from the `@heroui/react` package.
- **Export**:  
  - Executes the `heroui()` function and exports its result as the module's default export.

## Purpose

- To provide a reusable UI component (likely a "Hero" section, commonly used as a prominent introductory block on web pages), abstracting away its implementation details behind the imported library.

## Usage

- This module can be imported elsewhere in the application to render the standardized Hero UI component provided by `@heroui/react`. All props and functionality are managed by the third-party library.

**Note:** The specifics of the component's appearance and behavior are governed by the `@heroui/react` package, not the code shown here.
