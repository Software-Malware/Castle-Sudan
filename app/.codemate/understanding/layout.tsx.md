# High-Level Documentation of the Code

## Purpose

This code defines the root layout for a Next.js web application named "REZORYA". It sets up global providers, handles theme and context, and supplies initial state required for web3 (Wagmi) integration based on cookies in server-side requests.

---

## Functionality Overview

- **Project Branding:** Sets metadata for SEO with the title "REZORYA" and description.
- **Styling:** Imports a global CSS file to apply styles site-wide.
- **Provider Hierarchical Structure:** 
    - Wraps the application's content with `HeroUIProvider` (a UI library context).
    - Then wraps with a custom `Providers` component that receives an `initialState` (web3-related state derived from cookies).
- **Web3 State Initialization:**
    - Reads cookies from the server-side request headers using Next.js utilities.
    - Uses `wagmi`'s `cookieToInitialState` in combination with a configuration from `getConfig()` to build the initial state for web3 functionality on the client.
- **Internationalization:** Sets the HTML language attribute to "en".
- **Theme:** Sets a dark theme for the root body.
- **Server Component:** The root layout is an `async` server component to support data fetching during the SSR (Server Side Rendering) phase.

## File Role

This file acts as the main entry point for wrapping all pages/components with common providers and configuration. It ensures that every page gets proper context, styling, and initial server-prepared state, especially for third-party libraries like Wagmi and HeroUI.

## Main Components/Imports

- **Metadata (SEO)**
- **Global CSS**
- **HeroUIProvider:** UI library context provider.
- **Providers:** Application or web3 provider, consuming the initial state.
- **headers:** To read HTTP headers in SSR context.
- **cookieToInitialState:** Helper to extract initial client state from cookies.
- **getConfig:** Provides Wagmi/web3 configuration.

## Summary

The code establishes the foundational layout and provider context for a Next.js application, ensuring consistent theming, web3 connectivity, and global context from the very entry point of the application.
