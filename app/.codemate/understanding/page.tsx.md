# High-Level Documentation: Navbar Component

## Overview

`Navbar` is a React functional component designed for a web application using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with Ethereum smart contract interaction capabilities. This component provides a branded header, a Web3 wallet connect button (via RainbowKit), and an interface for interacting with an Ethereum smart contract.

---

## Major Responsibilities

- **Display Branding:**  
  Shows the application name "eth-builder" as a header.

- **Wallet Connection:**  
  Integrates a wallet connection interface using the `ConnectButton` from RainbowKit, allowing users to connect their Ethereum wallets.

- **Contract Data Initialization:**  
  Fetches and provides the smart contract address and ABI (Application Binary Interface) using a custom `getContractData` hook (implementation not shown).

- **Contract Interaction:**  
  Renders a `ContractInteraction` component, passing the contract ABI as a prop to facilitate frontend interactions with the deployed smart contract.

---

## UI & Styling

- Uses utility-first CSS classes (likely with Tailwind CSS) for layout, fonts, spacing, and color theme.
- Centers content and ensures screens are filled vertically.
- The color scheme/dark mode is implied by `data-theme="night"`.

---

## Components and Imports

- **ConnectButton:**  
  From RainbowKit; manages wallet connection/authentication state.

- **getContractData:**  
  Custom hook to retrieve contract deployment details (address and ABI).

- **ContractInteraction:**  
  Custom component for interacting with the smart contract functionality.

---

## Behavior

1. On component render:
   - Fetches contract details (address and ABI) once.
   - Renders the app title, wallet connect button, and a secondary header "Hello".
   - Passes the contract ABI to the `ContractInteraction` component for handling smart contract functions.
2. Maintains a simple, clean layout with a focus on functionality and user experience.

---

## Limitations / Notes

- **No navigation controls** or links beyond the ConnectButton.
- TerminalScroll functionality is commented out/removed.
- All contract interactions are expected to occur within the `ContractInteraction` component.

---

## Usage Context

This component is meant to be placed at the top level of a page, serving as a persistent navbar/header while providing critical Web3 connection and smart contract interaction features for an Ethereum dApp.
