# High-Level Documentation

This code is a configuration file, likely a CSS or PostCSS file (e.g., `tailwind.config.css` or similar), which sets up and customizes a web project's styling environment. Here's an overview of what it does:

### 1. **Imports and Plugins**
- **TailwindCSS Import:** Loads TailwindCSS's core styles and utility classes.
- **Custom Plugin (`hero.ts`):** Integrates a custom plugin from the local project (likely adds custom components or utilities).
- **DaisyUI Plugin:** Adds the DaisyUI plugin for component-focused UI styles with custom theme listings.
    - Themes:
        - **light** as the default theme
        - **abyss** as the "prefers dark" theme
        - **cupcake**
- **Source Directive:** Extends the project with assets/scripts from the HeroUI theme library.
- **Custom Variant (`dark`):** Defines a CSS variant that applies styles for dark mode using `[&:is(.dark *)]`.

### 2. **Theme Customization**
- Customizes CSS variables for theme colors when `[data-theme="night"]` is present.
    - Sets primary and secondary colors specifically for this theme.

### 3. **CSS Variables and Fonts**
- **Inline Theme Section:** Defines base CSS variables for background and foreground colors, as well as font families, mapped to other pre-set variables.
    - Background and foreground colors
    - Sans and mono font families

### 4. **Global Styles**
- Sets the default font family for the `body` element to Arial, Helvetica, and sans-serif as a fallback chain.
