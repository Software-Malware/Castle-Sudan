# Code Review Report

**File:** `hero.ts`  
**Reviewed Critically For:**  
- Industry standards and best practices  
- Code structure and clarity  
- Unoptimized implementations  
- Errors and typos  

---

## Findings

### 1. Import Statement Case Sensitivity

- **Issue:**  
  The import statement `import { heroui } from "@heroui/react";` assumes that the named export is `heroui` (all lowercase). Industry convention for React components is PascalCase (e.g. `HeroUI`). Additionally, the npm package name should match actual availability.
- **Suggested Correction:**
  ```typescript
  import { HeroUI } from "@heroui/react";
  ```

---

### 2. Default Export Usage

- **Issue:**  
  The code does `export default heroui();`, which immediately calls the function. This is potentially incorrect if `heroui` (or `HeroUI`) is a component (class or function), not a function to be called at import time.
- **Suggestions:**  
  - If `HeroUI` is a **component**, it should be exported as:
    ```typescript
    export default HeroUI;
    ```
  - If `HeroUI` is a **function** returning a component or element, you should ensure proper props are passed or handled:
    ```typescript
    export default HeroUI(props);
    ```

---

### 3. Unoptimized Implementations

- **Issue:**  
  The file simply re-exports a component with no added logic or documentation. While not an error, this provides no added value and may lead to confusion or unnecessary indirection in codebase navigation.
- **Suggestion:**  
  - Add documentation explaining the purpose of this wrapper file, or remove it unless an abstraction is needed.

---

### 4. Typings (For TypeScript)

- **Issue:**  
  No explicit typing or type annotation is given for what is exported.
- **Suggestion:**  
  - If possible, provide type annotation for better clarity:
    ```typescript
    import { HeroUI, HeroUIProps } from "@heroui/react";
    export default HeroUI as React.FC<HeroUIProps>;
    ```

---

## Recommended (Pseudo Code) Corrections

```typescript
// Correct import (use actual exported name and PascalCase)
import { HeroUI } from "@heroui/react";

// Correct export: do NOT invoke the component
export default HeroUI;

// Optionally, add type annotations if available
// import { HeroUI, HeroUIProps } from "@heroui/react";
// export default HeroUI as React.FC<HeroUIProps>;
```

## Summary Table

| Issue                    | Severity | Correction Suggestion                                      |
|--------------------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Import casing error      | High     | Use PascalCase `HeroUI`.                                   |
| Incorrect export usage   | High     | Do not invoke the component, export it as is.              |
| Lack of documentation    | Med      | Add/comment purpose of the file or remove unnecessary file.|
| Missing Type Annotations | Low      | Add typings if possible.                                   |

**Action Required:**  
Please refactor the code according to the suggested pseudo code to align with industry and TypeScript best practices.
