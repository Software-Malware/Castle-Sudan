# High-Level Documentation

## Purpose
This code defines a function, `getConfig`, which creates and returns a configuration object for use with the wagmi libraryâ€”a framework for building Ethereum-compatible web applications in React.

## Key Features

- **Supported Blockchains**: The configuration enables support for the Ethereum mainnet and the Sepolia testnet.
- **Storage Mechanism**: Uses cookies to persist application data, making it suitable for server-side rendering (SSR) scenarios.
- **Networking**: Sets up HTTP-based transport providers for blockchain interaction on both supported chains.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: The config is tailored for environments that use SSR, ensuring compatibility with Next.js and similar frameworks.

## Usage
Call the `getConfig()` function to retrieve the configured `wagmi` config object, then use it to initialize Ethereum providers and connect wallets in your application.
