# High-Level Documentation: tryToDisplay Utility

## Overview

This code provides utility functions designed to format and display a wide range of Ethereum-related data types within React applications. These utilities intelligently detect, format, and render Ethereum objects—such as addresses, BigNumbers, arrays, or plain values—either as human-friendly text or as JSX components.

## Main Functions

- **tryToDisplay(props)**  
  Automatically detects and formats the provided value (`thing`) and returns either JSX elements (for richer presentation) or plain text, depending on the type and provided props.
  
- **tryToDisplayAsText(thing)**  
  Always formats the value for display as plain text, suitable for logging or basic rendering.

## Supported Data Types and Display Logic

### 1. Ethereum BigNumbers

- **Recognition:** Detects objects with a `toNumber()` method—a common property on BigNumber instances from libraries such as ethers.js.
- **Formatting:**  
  - Attempts to convert the BigNumber to a standard JavaScript number.  
  - If not possible, tries interpreting the value as a raw Ether amount and formats it appropriately (e.g., converts Wei to Ether and appends the Ether symbol “Ξ”).
  - Depending on the context (`asText` flag), renders either as plain text or as a styled `<span>` element.

### 2. Ethereum Addresses

- **Recognition:** Detects strings that match the Ethereum address pattern (i.e., 0x-prefixed, 42 characters long).
- **Rendering:**  
  - As plain text for simple display.
  - As a reusable `<Address>` React component for enhanced presentations (e.g., reduced font size), if not in text-only mode.

### 3. Arrays

- **Recognition:** Processes JavaScript arrays with potentially mixed-value elements.
- **Formatting:**  
  - Preserves numbers and booleans.
  - Recursively formats nested elements for readability.
  - Converts to JSON strings when displaying as text, or pretty-prints arrays with line breaks for JSX.

### 4. Fallback for Other Types

- **Logic:**  
  - Converts the value to a JSON string as a last resort, ensuring any data type can be displayed meaningfully.

## Props and Configuration

- **thing:** The value to be displayed (can be any type).
- **asText (optional):** If true, forces display as text; otherwise, may return JSX.
- **blockExplorer (optional):** Placeholder for integrating address linking to block explorers (not currently utilized).

## Use Cases

- Displaying Ethereum data (addresses, balances, transaction values) in React components directly from contract responses or wallet-state objects.
- Debugging and development: easily rendering raw blockchain responses in a readable and convenient format.
- Building utility tables, logs, or interface sections for wallet and contract interaction UIs.

## Example Integration

```javascript
import { tryToDisplay } from './tryToDisplay';

function RenderEthereumData({ data }) {
  return <div>{tryToDisplay({ thing: data })}</div>;
}
```

## Extensibility

- Built to be easily extended with new data type checks or custom rendering formats as needed for additional Ethereum or blockchain-specific types.
- External components (e.g., `<Address>`) and utility functions (e.g., `formatUnits`) can be swapped or configured for alternative design systems or internationalization.

**Dependencies:**  
- Uses third-party libraries such as `wagmi` (for Ethereum address rendering), `viem` (for Ether unit formatting), and `ethers` (for BigNumber compatibility).

**Summary:**  
These utilities abstract away the complexity of rendering complex Ethereum data types in React, supporting better development, debugging, and user interfaces for Web3 applications.
