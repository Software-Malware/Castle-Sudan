# High-Level Documentation: tryToDisplay Utility

## Overview

The provided code exports two main utility functions for dynamically rendering arbitrary Ethereum-related data types (such as addresses, BigNumbers, arrays, and primitives) in React components:

- **tryToDisplay**: Formats and displays various data types as either human-friendly text or JSX elements.
- **tryToDisplayAsText**: Always formats data for display as plain text.

## Features

### 1. Handling Ethereum BigNumbers

- **Detection:** Recognizes objects containing a `toNumber()` method, which is typical for BigNumber objects.
- **Format:** 
  - If convertible to number, returns the number.
  - If not, attempts to display as an Ether value (using `formatUnits`).
  - Adds the Ethereum symbol (Îž) to display values.
  - Supports rendering as plain text or as a styled `<span>` element.

### 2. Ethereum Addresses

- **Detection:** Recognizes strings that look like Ethereum addresses (`0x...`, 42 chars).
- **Format:** Returns as text or renders using an `<Address>` React component (with adjustable font size).

### 3. Arrays

- **Detection:** Recognizes arrays of mixed types.
- **Format:** Attempts to make each array element readable:
  - Numbers and booleans are preserved as-is.
  - Other types are recursively handled.
- **Display:** Outputs a formatted JSON string, adding line breaks for readability when rendered as JSX.

### 4. Default/Fallback

- **All other types:** Returns a stringified version using `JSON.stringify`.

## Props Interface

- **thing (any):** The value to display.
- **asText (optional boolean):** If true, forces textual output; otherwise, may return JSX.
- **blockExplorer (optional string):** Reserved for potential integration with Ethereum block explorers, though not used in current logic.

## Usage

Use these utilities in React components to smartly render Ethereum data types, making debugging, logging, and UI presentation of contract- or wallet-related data easier.

## Example

```tsx
import { tryToDisplay } from './tryToDisplay';

function DataRenderer({myData}) {
  return <div>{tryToDisplay({thing: myData})}</div>;
}
```

## Extensibility

The code is built for easy extension to support more custom Ethereum data types and formatting needs.

**Note:** Relies on external libraries such as wagmi (for Address rendering), viem (for unit formatting), and ethers (for legacy support).
