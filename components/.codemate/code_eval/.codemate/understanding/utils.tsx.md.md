# High-Level Documentation: React tryToDisplay Utility Function

## Purpose

The `tryToDisplay` utility function is designed for React-based blockchain UI applications. Its main goal is to **display a wide variety of data types**—including Ethereum addresses, numbers, arrays, and other values—so users can see readable, useful information across diverse blockchain contexts.

---

## Core Functionality

- **Type-aware Rendering**: 
  - Detects the input type (`thing`): address, number, array, or fallback.
  - Displays addresses (like 0x... Ethereum addresses) with a special Address component or as a link to a block explorer.
  - For numbers and BigNumbers, formats them appropriately for display (with ETH-like units or decimals).
  - For arrays, presents items in an easy-to-read, broken-line format.
  - Fallback for other types is a stringified display.

- **Readability Enhancements**: 
  - Adds labels (like 'Ξ' for Ether).
  - Breaks long strings/arrays elegantly for better UI presentation.

- **Customization**:
  - Accepts props to control display (`asText`), decimal precision (`decimals`), preferred block explorer URL (`blockExplorer`), and more.

- **Type Safety & Error Handling**:
  - Makes use of TypeScript types and type guards to ensure only valid data (e.g., Ethereum addresses) are handled in special ways.
  - Catches and logs errors in data conversions (e.g., when converting to number).

---

## Key Input Props

- **thing** *(unknown)*: The value to display. Can be an address, number, array, object, etc.
- **asText** *(boolean, optional)*: Whether to render as plain text, not a React component.
- **blockExplorer** *(string, optional)*: Base URL for an Ethereum block explorer (Etherscan, Blockscout, etc.)
- **decimals** *(number, optional)*: Number of decimals for formatting numbers or tokens.

---

## Main Output Modes

- **Ethereum Address**: Detected and rendered as:
  - An interactive `<Address>` component.
  - Optionally, a clickable link to the block explorer if `blockExplorer` is provided.
- **Currency/Token Values**: Rendered using decimal formatting appropriate to specified `decimals`.
- **Arrays**: Elements are displayed in a readable, line-broken list.
- **General Objects/Strings**: Fallback to stringified display.

---

## Implementation Highlights

- **Type Guards & Validation**: Ensures addresses are valid before rendering as special components or links.
- **Configurable Decimals**: Avoids hardcoded "18 decimals" (ETH-style); supports dynamic decimal precision for ERC-20 and other tokens.
- **Robust Array Handling**: Avoids recursion pitfalls for nested arrays by stringifying deeply-nested structures where appropriate.
- **Error Robustness**: Catches number conversion errors and optionally logs them for debugging.
- **Styling**: Uses CSS classes for text wrapping and display, promoting maintainability over inline styles.

---

## Usage Example (Pseudo)

```jsx
<TryToDisplay 
  thing={userBalance}
  blockExplorer="https://etherscan.io"
  decimals={6} // For USDC, for example
/>
```

- Displays the user's balance in human-readable format, with appropriate decimals, and links address to Etherscan if relevant.

---

## Best Practice Alignment

- Use as a drop-in display utility for dynamic blockchain UI, especially in DApps that fetch and render arbitrary chain data.
- Adaptable for most EVM-compatible chains and token types due to customizability.

---

## Extendability

Recommended improvements include:
- Full integration with custom token metadata for per-token decimals.
- Support for ENS or address nickname resolution.
- Even wider compatibility for arrays and deeply-nested data.

---

**In summary:**  
`tryToDisplay` is a type-flexible, blockchain-specific React renderer intended to make contract and wallet data more accessible and useful to end-users.
