# Security Vulnerability Report

## Overview

The following report analyzes the provided code sample for **security vulnerabilities** only. The code is a Next.js client-side component that configures Ethereum wallet connection providers for a web app using RainbowKit, wagmi, and react-query. It manages blockchain provider configuration, connector setup for various wallets, and uses cookieStorage for user session management.

## Security Vulnerabilities

### 1. **Hardcoded Sensitive Information**

- **projectId Exposure**  
  ```js
  const projectId = '8f7168ddee799be92bb042a55ec97c2a'
  ```
  The `projectId` is exposed in the codebase. If this is sensitive or grants privileged access to any backend or third-party wallet service, exposing it client-side is a risk. Attackers can use this identifier to impersonate requests or abuse associated resources.

  **Recommendation:**  
  Store sensitive identifiers in environment variables (`process.env`) and only expose values that are strictly needed on the client. Regenerate the `projectId` if its exposure poses a risk.

---

### 2. **Hardcoded Blockchain Endpoint (RPC URL) with Potential Privilege**

- **Tenderly Mainnet Fork URL Exposure**  
  ```js
  rpcUrls: {
      default: {
        http: ['https://virtual.mainnet.eu.rpc.tenderly.co/5b9b3ca8-d8f4-454c-813c-3b0d0bebb72a'],
      },
      public: {
        http: ['https://virtual.mainnet.eu.rpc.tenderly.co/5b9b3ca8-d8f4-454c-813c-3b0d0bebb72a'],
      },
  },
  ```
  The code includes a **hardcoded endpoint** for Tenderly. If this is a private fork or has write access (e.g., forking Mainnet for tests with sensitive operations), sharing this URL can leak credentials and allow arbitrary parties to use or abuse the fork environment.

  **Recommendation:**  
  Use environment variables for any URLs that are, or will be, private/privileged. Periodically rotate or monitor usage of such endpoints.

---

### 3. **Cookie Storage Without Secure/HttpOnly/Domain/Path Flags**

- **Cookie Storage Configuration**  
  ```js
  storage: createStorage({ storage: cookieStorage }),
  ```
  The `cookieStorage` from wagmi is used, but **no flags are set regarding Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite, or domain/path constraints**. If these cookies store sensitive authentication or session information, they may be susceptible to:
    - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), as they are accessible via JavaScript
    - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), due to unsecured cross-origin usage

  [Note: Actual flags depend on the implementation of `cookieStorage` and supporting libraries, but absent explicit configuration or documentation, this is a concern.]

  **Recommendation:**  
  Ensure that all cookies storing sensitive user or session data are set with:
    - **`Secure`** (only sent via HTTPS)
    - **`HttpOnly`** (not accessible by JS unless strictly needed)
    - **`SameSite=Strict`** (prevent CSRF)
    - Explicit **domain/path restrictions** as appropriate

  If the underlying library does not support this, manually set cookies with secure flags or use alternate client-side storage mechanisms with great caution.

---

### 4. **Client-Side Only Wallet Configuration**

- `use client` exposes all JavaScript, including wallet configuration and network endpoints, to any user visiting the site. If you use **private RPC endpoints, internal testnets, or sensitive wallet groupings**, they are visible to all. This can lead to:
    - Abuse of private infrastructure
    - Enumeration of supported wallets (could be used for phishing/social engineering)
    - Extraction of configuration for use in malicious dApps

  **Recommendation:**  
  Only expose non-sensitive, public endpoints and configurations client-side. Protect private or privileged information using server-side code or authentication proxies if needed.

---

### 5. **No Input Validation/Sanitization of User Data**
While not directly related to this code, using `cookieStorage` or accepting wallet connections can introduce injection or data tampering risks if the code later reads/deserializes user-provided data **without validation**.

  **Recommendation:**  
  Ensure that any data read from cookies, local storage, or wallet payloads is properly validated and sanitized before further use (e.g., authentication flows, backend API calls).

## Summary Table

| Vulnerability                        | Severity  | Recommendation                                    |
|-------------------------------------- |-----------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Hardcoded `projectId`                | Medium    | Move to environment variable                      |
| Hardcoded privileged RPC URL         | High      | Move to environment variable / rotate credentials |
| CookieStorage insecure flags         | High      | Ensure Secure/HttpOnly/SameSite                   |
| Client-side exposure of all config   | Medium    | Only expose public config; protect private infra  |
| Lack of input validation/sanitization| Medium    | Sanitize all data from cookies/storage            |

---

## Overall Recommendations

1. **Move all sensitive credentials** (project IDs, RPC URLs) to safe storage (env variables).
2. **Configure cookie storage** to be secure (Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict, etc.).
3. **Audit all client-exposed configuration** for secrets and private infrastructure.
4. **Sanitize and validate** all user-controlled inputs, especially from local storage/cookies.
5. **Review wallet connection and session handling** for possible injection or data tampering.

**Note:**  
If the values (projectId, RPC endpoints) in this code are public/test values with no privilege, their exposure is less critical, but best practice is still to never hardcode or expose credentials unless required. Frequently audit client-side code for accidental leaks as part of your security process.
