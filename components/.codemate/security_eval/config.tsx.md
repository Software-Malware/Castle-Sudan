## Security Vulnerabilities Identified

### 1. Cookie Storage (`cookieStorage`)

- **Issue**: Storing sensitive data in cookies can be risky if cookies are not marked with secure flags (`Secure`, `HttpOnly`, and `SameSite`).
- **Impact**: Cookies without proper flags can be subject to [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](https://owasp.org/www-community/attack_vectors/XSS) and [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf) attacks.
- **Recommendation**: Ensure cookies use `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, and `SameSite=Strict` where possible. If `cookieStorage` settings are configurable, always set these attributes for any sensitive data.

### 2. SSR (Server-Side Rendering) Setting (`ssr: true`)

- **Issue**: SSR combined with cookie-based storage increases the risk of leaking sensitive information between users if cookies are not properly isolated or scoped.
- **Impact**: Potential for session fixation or leakage of user-specific data if cookies are improperly shared or managed during SSR processes.
- **Recommendation**: Validate that cookies are tied to the correct user/request context and that session handling for SSR does not leak data.

### 3. Unauthenticated HTTP Transport (`http()`)

- **Issue**: The transport configuration uses `http()` but does not specify endpoints or whether connections are TLS-encrypted (`https`).
- **Impact**: If communication occurs over plaintext HTTP, it exposes sensitive data to [man-in-the-middle (MitM)](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Man-in-the-middle_attack) attacks.
- **Recommendation**: Always use HTTPS endpoints; validate that `http()` resolves to HTTPS URLs.

### 4. Lack of Input Validation for Chains

- **Issue**: The chains are imported directly and assigned as an array. If these objects are modified upstream, it could lead to unintended connections or configuration issues.
- **Impact**: Could introduce malicious chain configurations if not properly validated.
- **Recommendation**: Validate input sources and objects before including them in sensitive configuration.

### 5. No Encryption of Storage Data

- **Issue**: Information stored in cookies may be sensitive (e.g., wallet information, session tokens) but the code does not show any encryption or safe handling.
- **Impact**: Attackers able to read cookies could compromise user accounts or steal session tokens.
- **Recommendation**: Encrypt sensitive data before storage and avoid storing private keys or secrets in client-accessible cookies.

## Summary Table

| Vulnerability           | Impact                  | Recommendation                           |
|------------------------ |------------------------ |------------------------------------------|
| Cookie Storage          | XSS, CSRF, Data Leak    | Set Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite flags     |
| SSR and Cookie Storage  | Data leakage            | Isolate cookie scope per request         |
| Unauthenticated HTTP    | MitM, Info Disclosure   | Use HTTPS for all remote endpoints       |
| No Chain Validation     | Malicious Config        | Validate chain objects before use        |
| No Storage Encryption   | Data Compromise         | Encrypt sensitive cookie content         |

## Final Recommendations

- **Harden cookie storage** using secure flags and consider alternatives for storing sensitive data.
- **Audit transport layer security** and ensure HTTPS is used everywhere.
- **Encrypt and validate all stored data.**
- **Review SSR context handling** to ensure secure cookie isolation.
- Regularly review all dependencies for upstream vulnerabilities.
