**High-Level Documentation of Code (`tryToDisplay` Utility Function):**

---

## Purpose

The `tryToDisplay` function is a React utility designed to intelligently render a wide variety of input data (`thing`). It attempts to display the value of `thing` in a human-friendly format, supporting both textual and JSX-based output. It is typically used to print or preview on-chain or user-supplied data of uncertain type in a UI.

---

## Key Features

- **Flexible Rendering:** Accepts any input (`thing: any`) and attempts to select an appropriate display format based on its type and content. Supports:
  - Plain strings and numbers
  - JSON objects (stringified)
  - Arrays (recursive rendering)
  - Ethereum addresses (with a dedicated `<Address />` component)
- **As Text Option:** The `asText` flag controls whether to output plain text or a richer JSX representation.
- **External Component Integration:** May render targeted values (e.g., addresses) using helper components such as `<Address />`, optionally linking to a provided block explorer.

---

## Usage Guidelines

- **Input Handling:** Accepts arbitrary and potentially untrusted data. Intended to be called from React components to display unknown or user-generated content.
- **Rendering Mode:** Returns either a simple string or a JSX element, depending on input and options.
- **Output Use:** The output should be rendered directly in JSX. Avoid injecting the output into the DOM as raw HTML.

---

## Security Considerations

- **XSS Protection:** By default, React escapes values rendered within JSX. However, output should **never** be used with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` or similar raw HTML injection mechanisms.
- **Validation:** Calling code and downstream components should validate and sanitize data before rendering, especially if data originates from users or untrusted sources.
- **Sensitive Data:** If inputs might contain confidential or sensitive information, ensure such fields are excluded before passing to this function.
- **Component Trust:** If using external components (like `Address`), verify they handle inputs securely and escape output appropriately.

---

## Extensibility

- **Plug-and-Play:** Designed for easy integration into React projects needing flexible value rendering.
- **Custom Handling:** Consumers can wrap, extend, or replace logic to tailor output for domain-specific data types.

## Example

```jsx
// Usage inside a React component
<Typography>
  {tryToDisplay({ thing: userInput, asText: false, blockExplorer: etherscanUrl })}
</Typography>
```

## Summary

- **What it does:** Safely renders unknown data for display in React.
- **How to use:** Pass any value (from trusted or untrusted sources) for a JSX/text preview.
- **Security:** Direct use in JSX is safe; never inject output as raw HTML, and validate/sanitize input for maximum security.
- **Best practice:** Use for previewing arbitrary data with appropriate external safety checks.
