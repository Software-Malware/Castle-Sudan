# Security Vulnerabilities Report

## Code Analyzed

The following review covers the code as provided, which is a TypeScript module for validating and returning contract data from a deployed contracts object:

```typescript
import { deployedContracts } from '@/contracts/deployedContracts';

interface ContractData {
  address: string;
  abi: readonly any[];
}

// Type guard to validate ContractData shape at runtime
function isContractData(obj: any): obj is ContractData {
  return (
    obj !== null &&
    typeof obj === 'object' &&
    typeof obj.address === 'string' &&
    Array.isArray(obj.abi)
  );
}

// Main function: validates and returns contract data structure
export default function getContractData(): Record<string, Record<string, ContractData>> {
  const result: Record<string, Record<string, ContractData>> = {};

  for (const [chainId, chainConfig] of Object.entries(deployedContracts)) {
    if (chainConfig === null || typeof chainConfig !== 'object') {
      throw new Error(`Invalid chain config for chainId "${chainId}"`);
    }
    const chainResult: Record<string, ContractData> = {};
    for (const [contractName, contractData] of Object.entries(chainConfig)) {
      if (isContractData(contractData)) {
        chainResult[contractName] = {
          address: contractData.address,
          abi: contractData.abi,
        };
      } else {
        throw new Error(`Invalid contract data for "${contractName}" on chain "${chainId}"`);
      }
    }
    result[chainId] = chainResult;
  }

  return result;
}
```

## Security Vulnerabilities

### 1. **Lack of Input Validation / Sanitization for `deployedContracts` Contents**

**Issue:**  
The code expects `deployedContracts` to contain objects with the expected shape but only validates that `address` is a string and `abi` is an array. There is no further validation on the contents of `address`. In blockchain contexts, contract addresses should match certain formats (for Ethereum, a hexadecimal string of length 42 starting with "0x"). Accepting arbitrary strings could introduce vulnerabilities if those values are used elsewhere (e.g., directly passed to contract interactions).

**Risk:**  
- **DTO Tampering:** Malicious data could inject invalid or potentially dangerous addresses.
- **Information Leakage:** Accepting and re-exporting unvalidated contract information could accidentally expose invalid, malicious, or unintended addresses and ABIs.
- **Downstream Risks:** Any code that uses these addresses to interact with the blockchain may be vulnerable to attacks if the addresses are not properly formatted (e.g., sending transactions to unintended or attacker-controlled contracts).

**Recommendation:**  
- Implement stricter validation for contract addresses (e.g., regex that matches canonical addresses for the target chain).
- Validate the contents of the ABI array, at minimum ensuring it is an array of objects compatible with expected standards.

---

### 2. **Potential Prototype Pollution**

**Issue:**  
The code uses `Object.entries()` to iterate over `deployedContracts` and its sub-objects. If `deployedContracts` is manipulated externally or not properly constructed, there is potential for prototype pollution, where prototype properties/methods could be iterated and processed as if they were contracts.

**Risk:**  
- **Prototype Pollution:** Attackers may be able to inject malicious keys (`__proto__`, `constructor`, etc.) into `deployedContracts`, influencing the behavior of code or causing unexpected results.

**Recommendation:**  
- Use `Object.hasOwnProperty` checks, or `Object.keys()`/`for...in` with `hasOwnProperty` when iterating user-controlled or external objects.
- Deep-clone and sanitize the input object at boundaries before processing.

---

### 3. **Error Messaging / Possible Information Disclosure**

**Issue:**  
The thrown error messages may contain raw chain IDs and contract names. If these errors bubble up to user-facing logs or external systems, they could provide an attacker with additional information about internal contract structure.

**Risk:**  
- **Information Disclosure:** Revealing specific contract names and chain IDs might help attackers map the system or target specific components.

**Recommendation:**  
- Sanitize error logging and avoid propagating raw internal values to the user or external logs.

---

### 4. **No Security Controls on Imported Data**

**Issue:**  
The code assumes trust in the `deployedContracts` import. If this file or its source is compromised or manipulated (including via supply chain attacks or insecure update mechanisms), malicious data could be processed without detection.

**Risk:**  
- **Import Tampering:** Processing manipulated contract data may lead to interacting with attacker-controlled addresses or exposing ABIs for unauthorized contracts.

**Recommendation:**  
- Ensure integrity and authenticity of imported contract config files.
- Implement validation and security checks at boundaries, not only at runtime.

## Recommendations Summary

- **Validate addresses** to ensure only correctly formatted contract addresses are accepted.
- **Check ABIs** for valid structure.
- **Prevent prototype pollution** by controlling object key iteration.
- **Sanitize error messages**, avoid leaking internal data.
- **Validate imported config data** for authenticity and integrity.
