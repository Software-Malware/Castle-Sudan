**High-Level Documentation**

This code exports a configuration object used for setting up PostCSS plugins in a project. The configuration specifies that the PostCSS plugin from Tailwind CSS (@tailwindcss/postcss) should be used. This setup is commonly part of a build process to enable advanced CSS features and Tailwind utility classes within the project's stylesheets. The configuration is provided as a default export, making it available for use by build tools or other modules that require PostCSS configuration.
