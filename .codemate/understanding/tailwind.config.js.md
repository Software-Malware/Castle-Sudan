# High-Level Documentation

This module exports a configuration object specifically designed for customizing **DaisyUI**, a popular Tailwind CSS plugin that provides pre-built themes and UI components.

## Features & Options in this Configuration

- **themes**:  
  An array specifying the included DaisyUI themes (e.g., "light", "dark", "cupcake", "retro", etc.). These are the theme options available in your project for easy switching and theming.

- **darkTheme**:  
  Designates the default dark mode theme, set here to **"dark"**.

- **base**:  
  If `true`, applies default background and text colors from the theme to your app’s `<body>`.

- **styled**:  
  When `true`, DaisyUI will include its own design decisions (like color palette and some visual styles) for components.

- **utils**:  
  Adds DaisyUI’s responsive and modifier utility classes when set to `true`.

- **prefix**:  
  A string to prefix DaisyUI class names. Here, it is an empty string, so no prefix is used.

- **logs**:  
  When set to `true`, DaisyUI will display information about its current version and configuration in your build/dev console.

**Summary**:  
This configuration customizes DaisyUI to include a wide selection of built-in themes, enables dark mode, and turns on useful extras like base styling, utility classes, and logging. No custom class prefix is applied. This setup is typical for projects wanting flexible theming with DaisyUI’s component library in a Tailwind CSS environment.
