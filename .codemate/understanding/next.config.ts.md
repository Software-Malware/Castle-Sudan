This code defines a configuration for a Next.js application, specifically setting custom HTTP headers for all incoming requests. Its key aspects are:

1. **Purpose:**  
   - To enforce security-related browser policies that affect cross-origin isolation and resource sharing.

2. **Headers Set:**  
   - **Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin**
   - **Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp**
   These headers enable advanced security features in modern browsers, required for certain APIs (such as SharedArrayBuffer and WebAssembly threads), by directing browsers to isolate your site from other origins and require resources to be explicitly "cross-origin resource policy"-compliant.

3. **Scope:**  
   - The configuration applies these headers to every route in the application (`source: '/(.*)'`).

4. **Export:**  
   - The configuration object is exported as the default for use by Next.js during server setup.

5. **Type Safety:**  
   - Uses TypeScript typing (`NextConfig`) to ensure configuration conforms with Next.js expectations.

This setup is typical for web applications that require cross-origin isolation for security or feature support.
