# High-Level Documentation

## Overview

This configuration file is for the TypeScript compiler within a **Next.js project**. It defines how TypeScript should interpret, compile, and handle source files, libraries, and modules in the codebase.

---

## Key Features

- **Target & Library Support**
  - Targets ECMAScript 2017 (`ES2017`) output.
  - Includes latest ECMAScript, DOM, and DOM iterable APIs.

- **JS & TS Integration**
  - Allows JavaScript files in the compilation.
  - Strict type-checking is enabled for safer code.
  - Skips type checking of external libraries for faster builds.

- **Module Handling**
  - Uses ESNext modules and ESModule interop for broader compatibility.
  - Enables resolution of JSON imports and isolated modules (ideal for Next.js).
  - Uses modern bundler-based module resolution.

- **React/Next.js Support**
  - JSX syntax is preserved for React/Next.js tooling.
  - Includes a plugin for Next.js (`next`).

- **Path Aliases**
  - Provides a path alias (`@/*`) for simplified import paths.

- **Incremental Compilation**
  - Supports faster builds with incremental compilation.

- **File Scope**
  - Includes TypeScript declaration files, `.ts`, `.tsx` files, and Next.js types.
  - Excludes the `node_modules` directory from compilation.

## Intended Usage

- Designed for projects using Next.js and React with TypeScript.
- Optimized for strict type safety, fast builds, and modern JavaScript features.
- Makes code easy to manage with aliases and up-to-date language features.

## Extensibility

Developers can adjust compiler options, include/exclude patterns, and plugins to fit larger or more customized Next.js or React projects.
