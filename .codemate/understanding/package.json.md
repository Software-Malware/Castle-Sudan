## Features

- **Frontend Framework**: Uses Next.js for React-based server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **UI Libraries**: Integrates HeroUI, DaisyUI, Shadcn, and React Icons for rich, customizable user interfaces.
- **Web3 Support**: Supports blockchain and Web3 features with libraries such as Wagmi, Ethers, RainbowKit, WalletConnect, Web3Modal, Abitype, and Viem.
- **Theming**: Enables dark/light theme switching via Next Themes and TailwindCSS utilities.
- **Animation**: Utilizes Framer Motion for smooth animations.
- **State/Data Management**: Uses TanStack React Query for powerful data fetching and cache management.
- **Component Development**: Includes reusable input, button, switch, navbar, listbox, snippet, and system components from HeroUI.
- **Development Tools**: TypeScript for type safety, TailwindCSS for utility-first CSS, and PostCSS for post-processing.
