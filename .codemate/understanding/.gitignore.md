# High-Level Documentation: `.gitignore` File

This file specifies files and directories that should be ignored by Git in this repository. It prevents unnecessary or sensitive files from being tracked and included in version control, improving security and workflow efficiency.

## Main Sections

1. **Dependencies**
   - Ignores directories and files related to Node.js, Yarn, and other package managers (e.g., `node_modules`, `.pnp`, `.yarn/*`).
   - Excludes specific Yarn folders from ignore (patches, plugins, releases, versions).

2. **Testing**
   - Ignores test coverage reports (`/coverage`).

3. **Next.js**
   - Ignores build/output folders generated by Next.js (`/.next/`, `/out/`).

4. **Production Builds**
   - Ignores production build folders (`/build`).

5. **Miscellaneous**
   - Ignores MacOS system files (`.DS_Store`).
   - Ignores PEM files (`*.pem`).

6. **Debug and Log Files**
   - Ignores debug and error logs for npm, yarn and pnpm.

7. **Environment Files**
   - Ignores environment variable files (`.env*`), unless you opt-in to commit them.

8. **Vercel**
   - Ignores the Vercel deployment folder (`.vercel`).

9. **TypeScript**
   - Ignores TypeScript build info and environment files (`*.tsbuildinfo`, `next-env.d.ts`).

## Summary

This `.gitignore` is tailored to a modern JavaScript/TypeScript application using Next.js, Yarn, and Vercel. It ensures that build artifacts, dependencies, sensitive credentials, and unnecessary files are excluded from version control while allowing some critical directories for Yarn to be tracked.
