# High-Level Documentation

This configuration file is an `.editorconfig` file, used to define and maintain consistent coding styles between different editors and IDEs for a project.

- The `root = true` line specifies that this is the top-most `.editorconfig` file and no further configuration files should be processed up the directory hierarchy.
- The `[*]` section applies the following settings to all files in the project:
  - `charset = utf-8`: Files should use UTF-8 character encoding.
  - `end_of_line = lf`: Lines should end with line feed (LF) characters.
  - `indent_size = 2`: Each indentation level uses two characters.
  - `indent_style = space`: Indentation is done with spaces, not tabs.
  - `insert_final_newline = true`: Files should end with a newline.

In summary, this file enforces basic text formatting conventions to promote consistency in source files, regardless of the editor used.
