# High-Level Documentation: Next.js Starter Project

## Overview

This is a web application project built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), initialized with the `create-next-app` command. Next.js is a React-based framework for building modern web applications with features like server-side rendering, static site generation, API routes, and built-in optimizations.

## Key Features

- **Modern Frontend Stack:** Built on top of React with Next.js for optimal performance and developer experience.
- **Built-in Development Server:** Run locally for live editing and instant updates at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
- **Automatic Font Optimization:** Utilizes [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to seamlessly load and optimize fonts, specifically [Geist](https://vercel.com/font).
- **Hot Reloading:** Changes to files (e.g., `app/page.tsx`) are automatically reflected in the browser.
- **Easy Deployment:** Designed to be deployed easily on [Vercel](https://vercel.com), the platform created by Next.js authors.

## How to Use

1. **Local Development:**  
   Start the development server using your preferred package manager.  
   - Commands:  
     ```
     npm run dev
     # or
     yarn dev
     # or
     pnpm dev
     # or
     bun dev
     ```

2. **Editing:**  
   - Modify `app/page.tsx` to change the main page content.

3. **Browser Access:**  
   - Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view your application.

4. **Deployment:**  
   - Follow the Next.js [deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for hosting options, with Vercel being recommended.
