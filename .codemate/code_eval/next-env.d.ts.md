# Code Review Report

## Code Provided

```typescript
/// <reference types="next" />
/// <reference types="next/image-types/global" />

// NOTE: This file should not be edited
// see https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/typescript for more information.
```

---

## Critical Review

### 1. Industry Standards

- **Usage of Triple Slash Directives**: The use of triple-slash directives is generally acceptable for type definitions. However, these are legacy features and are increasingly replaced with `tsconfig.json` `typeRoots` or `types`. Relying on TypeScript compiler settings is more standardized and less error-prone at scale.

#### Suggested Code (Pseudo code)

```jsonc
// In tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "types": ["next", "next/image-types/global"]
  }
}
```

---

### 2. Unoptimized Implementation

- **File Editability Comment**: The comment states that the file shouldn't be edited, which is a good practice for auto-generated/config files. No direct optimization is required here.

- **Documentation Reference**: Good practice. No action required.

---

### 3. Errors

- **No Functional Code Present**: The file contains no functional code, only setup comments and type references. No direct errors detected.

---

### 4. Additional Recommendations

- **Directory Placement**: Ensure this file is placed in the correct configuration directory as per Next.js guidelines (`/app`, `/src` or root).

- **File Naming Convention**: This file should be clearly named (e.g., `next-env.d.ts`) and omitted from source control if it is auto-generated.

- **TypeScript Strictness**: Enforce strict type-checking via your `tsconfig.json` for better industry standard adherence.

#### Suggested Code (Pseudo code for tsconfig.json)

```jsonc
// In tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true
  }
}
```

## Summary

- Prefer using `tsconfig.json` for type references instead of triple-slash directives.
- No functional code errors or unoptimized implementations detected.
- Ensure configurations follow Next.js documentation and industry standards for file placement and naming.
- Enforce strict type checking for robust codebase management.
