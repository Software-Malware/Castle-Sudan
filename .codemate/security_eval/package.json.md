# Security Vulnerability Report

## Overview

The provided code is a `package.json` configuration file for a Node.js application using Next.js and React. It lists several dependencies and devDependencies, some of which have known or potential security concerns. This report identifies security vulnerabilities and risks based solely on the listed packages and their specified versions.

---

## 1. Use of Outdated or Vulnerable Packages

### **@walletconnect/web3-provider** (`^1.8.0`)
- **Status:** Deprecated and known for multiple security issues.
- **Concerns:** This package is no longer maintained. It has reported vulnerabilities in session management, authentication, and possible phishing risks.
- **Recommendation:** Migrate to [`@walletconnect/ethereum-provider`](https://github.com/WalletConnect/ethereum-provider) or another maintained provider.

### **web3modal** (`^1.9.12`)
- **Status:** v1 is deprecated, known security issues.
- **Concerns:** Web3Modal v1 has known vulnerabilities regarding provider phishing, lack of proper session validation, and insufficient protection against malicious providers.
- **Recommendation:** Upgrade to [Web3Modal v2](https://web3modal.com/) for improved security, or use other alternatives with active support.

### **blockies** (`^0.0.2`) and **react-blockies** (`^1.4.1`)
- **Status:** Potentially outdated, weak cryptographic implementations.
- **Concerns:** Blockies are used for Ethereum address visualization. Older versions may use insecure hashing or random number generation, leading to possible collisions or predictable outputs.
- **Recommendation:** Verify the implementation for cryptographically secure randomness, or consider alternative libraries.

## 2. General Risks with Front-End and Crypto Libraries

### **ethers** (`^6.15.0`)
- **Concerns:** While `ethers` is widely used, older versions sometimes have vulnerabilities in wallet management and insecure default providers. Version `6.15.0` is recent, but always monitor for CVEs as new vulnerabilities are discovered.

### **wagmi** (`^2.16.1`)
- **Concerns:** Being a web3-related package, ensure you monitor for bug fixes related to session security, XSS, and proper authentication flows.

### **@rainbow-me/rainbowkit** (`^2.2.8`)
- **Concerns:** Web3 wallet kits can expose attack surfaces related to phishing or replay attacks. Ensure you implement safe wallet connection UX and monitor the package for security updates.

---

## 3. Insecure/Unrestricted Package Versions

- Several package versions are specified with broad semver ranges (`^`, `x`, or no restriction), which may lead to inconsistent dependency resolution and risk of accidental inclusion of vulnerable versions.
    - Example: `"viem": "2.x"` may pull in non-backward-compatible changes or untested versions.
    - Example: `"@types/blockies": "^0"` (insecure, should be pinned to a specific safe version).

---

## 4. Absence of Security-related Scripts or Controls

- No built-in scripts for dependency vulnerability checks (like running [audit](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-audit) or [snyk](https://snyk.io/)).
- **Recommendation:** Add `"audit": "yarn audit"` and integrate automatic security checks into your CI/CD pipeline.

---

## 5. Potential Supply Chain Risks

- **No package integrity lock:** No reference to lockfiles (`yarn.lock`, `package-lock.json`), which are crucial to prevent dependency hijacking.
- **Recommendation:** Always commit `yarn.lock` and enable lockfile security features to ensure repeatable, secure installs.

---

## 6. Risks in DevDependencies

- Some devDependencies such as **TailwindCSS**, **TypeScript**, and React types are typically low-risk, but ensure these are kept up to date due to frequent fixes for supply chain and RCE vulnerabilities.

---

## 7. No Explicit Security Policy or Controls

- There is no indication of runtime protections, sandboxing, or CSP (Content Security Policy) headers, which are critical for Next.js and React apps.

## **Summary Table**

| Dependency                      | Type        | Security Risk                             | Recommendation                              |
|----------------------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| @walletconnect/web3-provider     | Runtime    | Deprecated, multiple security issues      | Migrate to maintained alternative            |
| web3modal                       | Runtime    | Deprecated, phishing/session risks        | Upgrade to v2 or maintained alternative      |
| blockies/react-blockies          | Runtime    | Possible weak randomness/hash             | Audit and consider secure alternatives       |
| viem                            | Runtime    | Unrestricted semver                       | Pin to a specific, tested version            |
| General packages                 | General    | Supply chain risk                         | Use lockfiles and run audit tools            |

## **Actionable Recommendations**

1. **Upgrade/deprecate** insecure packages (`@walletconnect/web3-provider`, `web3modal v1`).
2. **Pin all dependencies** to tested, stable versions.
3. **Add automatic vulnerability scripts** (e.g., `yarn audit`).
4. **Commit and manage lockfiles** for supply chain security.
5. **Monitor releases** of all crypto/web3-related libraries and react quickly to security advisories.
