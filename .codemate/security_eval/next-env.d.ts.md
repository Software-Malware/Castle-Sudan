## Summary

The code provided consists solely of TypeScript reference directives and comments. It does not contain any executable code, business logic, or configuration that may impact runtime behavior or security. As such, there are **no observable security vulnerabilities** in the code provided.

## Detailed Analysis

### TypeScript Reference Directives

- `/// <reference types="next" />`
- `/// <reference types="next/image-types/global" />`

These statements are used to include type information for Next.js and related image types in TypeScript projects. They do not introduce security risks on their own, as they simply inform the TypeScript compiler about available types. 

### Comments

- The only comment reminds developers not to edit this file and points to documentation.
- Comments do not affect runtime security.

### No Runtime Code

- There is no Javascript, TypeScript, configuration, or API code.
- No file or network operations, data handling, or input/output processing occurs.
- No secrets, tokens, or credentials are present.

## Conclusion

**No security vulnerabilities have been detected in the provided code.**  
This file is safe, as it only contains type reference directives and comments. No further security actions are necessary.
