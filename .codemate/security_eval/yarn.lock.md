# Security Vulnerability Report

This report analyzes the provided code (specifically, a Yarn `yarn.lock` file in YAML format) and lists security vulnerabilities related to packages and their versions, as of data available as of June 2024. The analysis is based on public vulnerability databases (e.g., npm advisories, CVE, Snyk, GitHub advisories) and common security practices. This report only covers **direct and transitive package vulnerabilities**; your code integration/configuration is not analyzed.

## Critical and High Vulnerabilities

### 1. [`cookie@0.7.2`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cookie)
- **Dependency:** Used via `@bundled-es-modules/cookie@2.0.1` → `cookie@^0.7.2`
- **Vulnerability:** [CVE-2023-26136](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-26136): Prototype Pollution via malformed set-cookie input; may allow Denial of Service or escalate to code execution in specific Node.js contexts.
- **Affected Versions:** `< 0.7.4`
- **Fixed in:** `>=0.7.4`
- **Recommendation:** Upgrade `cookie` as soon as possible. If direct upgrade is not possible, audit usage to ensure input is sanitized.

## Other Known Vulnerabilities

### 2. [`raw-body@3.0.0`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/raw-body)
- **Dependency:** `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk@1.17.2` → `raw-body@^3.0.0`
- **Vulnerability:** [CVE-2024-34166](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-34166): Denial of Service due to lenient content length handling when used with certain body parsers.
- **Affected Versions:** `< 3.1.2`
- **Fixed in:** `3.1.2`
- **Recommendation:** Upgrade to `raw-body@3.1.2` or later.

## Indirectly Included Vulnerable Libraries

### 3. [`eventsource@3.0.2`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eventsource)
- **Dependency:** `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk@1.17.2` → `eventsource@^3.0.2`
- **Vulnerabilities:**
    - [CVE-2023-33380, SNYK-JS-EVENTSOURCE-6102253](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-EVENTSOURCE-6102253): Prototype Pollution and potential Denial of Service.
- **Fixed in:** `>= 3.1.13`
- **Recommendation:** Upgrade or avoid use if possible.

### 4. [`express@5.0.1`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
- **Dependency:** `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk@1.17.2` → `express@^5.0.1`
- **Status:** Express v5 is in beta and may not receive security updates, while older versions (<4.18.x) have many known issues. Always use latest non-beta production releases for critical applications.
- **Recommendation:** If possible, use Express 4.18.x pending Express 5 stable, and keep up-to-date with advisories.

---

## [Observations on Peer and Optional Dependencies](#observations-on-peer-and-optional-dependencies)
- Some packages list broad peer dependency versions (such as `react: >=18 || >=19.0.0-rc.0`).
- For packages such as `socket.io-client, eciesjs, eventemitter2, readable-stream`, please make sure you are using up-to-date, secure versions since these have occasionally had vulnerabilities in the past.

---

## Recommendations

1. **Regularly Run Security Audits**  
   Use `yarn audit`, `npm audit`, or [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) to programmatically scan for new vulnerabilities periodically.

2. **Upgrade Immediately:**
   - `cookie` to >=0.7.4 (Check if `@bundled-es-modules/cookie` supports this version)
   - `raw-body` to >=3.1.2
   - `eventsource` to >=3.1.13

3. **Monitor Vulnerabilities in Beta/Experimental Packages**
   - `express@5.x` is still in beta; prefer latest stable (4.18+) for production where possible, or closely monitor for breaking changes and security advisories.

4. **For Indirect Dependencies**
   - If vulnerabilities cannot be resolved through direct upgrades, request upstream package maintainers to update their dependencies.

5. **Pin Versions Where Appropriate**
   - For particularly critical or vulnerable packages, pin to secure versions in `resolutions` or another override mechanism if your yarn/npm/lockfile tooling supports it.

6. **Transitive Dependencies**
   - Some vulnerabilities arise deep within the dependency tree. Check your lockfile after updating and verify vulnerable package versions have been replaced.

7. **General Maintenance**
   - Regularly update all packages (direct and indirect) by running `yarn upgrade --latest` and rerun security audits.

---

## Summary

The lockfile contains several indirect dependencies with known vulnerabilities, the most critical being in the `cookie` and `raw-body` packages, as well as `eventsource`. Address these as a priority. Maintaining up-to-date dependencies and running regular security audits is essential for mitigating future risks.
