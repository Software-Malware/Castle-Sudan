# High-Level Documentation: Scaffold-ETH Autogenerated Contract Deployment List

This file defines the deployed contracts and their ABIs (Application Binary Interfaces) for use in front-end or integration scripts, specifically as autogenerated by the Scaffold-ETH framework.

## Structure

- **Network Mapping**: The exported object (`deployedContracts`) maps chain IDs (e.g., `1` for Ethereum Mainnet and `31337` for local Hardhat) to deployed smart contract info.
- **Contract Record**: For each chain, the contract record includes:
  - `address`: Deployed contract address.
  - `abi`: Array describing contract constructor, events, and callable/readable functions.
  - `inheritedFunctions`: Reserved (empty in this template).
  - `deployedOnBlock`: The block number at which the contract was deployed.

## Main Contract: `YourContract`

### Key Features & Capabilities

- **Liquidity Pool Operations**:
  - `addLiquidity(rezAmount)`: Allows a user to add both ETH (on-chain value sent) and REZ tokens to the pool.
  - `removeLiquidity(liquidity)`: Allows a user to remove liquidity from the pool.
  - `ethReserve`, `rezReserve`: Read functions to get the current reserves of ETH and REZ in the pool.
  - `MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY`: Constant for pool operation.

- **Swapping**:
  - `swapETHForREZ(minRezOut)`: Swap ETH for at least a minimum REZ token output.
  - `swapREZForETH(rezIn, minEthOut)`: Swap REZ for at least a minimum ETH output.
  - `getAmountOut(amountIn, reserveIn, reserveOut)`: Pure helper to calculate output from input and reserve pair.
  - `getCurrentPrice()`: Returns the current ETH/REZ price.

- **ERC-20 Token Interface** (for LP tokens, typically):
  - `balanceOf(address)`, `totalSupply()`, `name()`, `symbol()`, `decimals()`
  - `transfer(to, amount)`, `transferFrom(from, to, amount)`
  - `approve(spender, amount)`, `allowance(owner, spender)`
  - `owner()`, `transferOwnership()` and `futureOwner()` for permission management.

- **Events**:
  - Standard ERC-20 events (`Transfer`, `Approval`)
  - Pool-specific events (`AddLiquidity`, `RemoveLiquidity`, `Swap`) to facilitate UI and analytics tracking.

- **Fallback Receive Function**:
  - Allows the contract to natively receive ETH.

## Usage

- **Do Not Edit Manually**: This file is intended for automated use in the Scaffold-ETH framework and is overwritten by deployments.
- **Front-End Integration**: Import and use to get contract addresses/ABIs for interacting with deployed contracts in dApps.

## Networks Supported

- **Ethereum Mainnet** (`1`)
- **Hardhat Local Testnet** (`31337`)
